      "Much like Apple they launch major updates only 2 times a year So when they announce something new it’s the result of months of hard work thinking and testing\n",

      "The returns of great design elegant decisions for big pain points\n",

      "450 000\n",
      "That’s the amount of tech workers that were laid off between 2021 and today\n",

      "drivers of conversions\n",
      "and can be used as selling points for design decisions\n",
      "Airbnb’s latest launch shows us how great designers can come up with simple solutions to the two big pain points\n",
      "Designing for trust the Guest Favorite category\n",
      "Their research team found out that trust and reliability were a huge bottleneck in their experience\n",
      "For guests the moment of arriving at a property was full of unwanted surprises the “dedicated workspace” was actually a small table on a dirty corner The hot tub advertised is there but broken\n",
      "In face of that the goal becomes how to solve the problem of building trust at scale That issue was solved elegantly by adding another tier of hosts called Guest Favorites\n",
      "The addition reflected on the UI in two ways\n",
      "Search results that optimize for showing properties in that category\n",
      "Beautifully designed icons and tags to differentiate the properties\n",
      "Designing for ease of use organizing the listings tab\n",
      "In Brian’s mind to have a great end user experience you need great hosts To have great hosts you need to provide them with great tools And the listing experience on Airbnb was far from that\n",

      "Better information architecture for ease of access\n",
      "Search and better filters\n",
      "Not to say it’s easy to do but the output is a simplified design that makes the experience much better They prioritized what made sense hid less used features and made things work\n",
      "From the\n",

      "“It’s going to make so that you as a host are able to update your listing more easily You’re definitely going to get more bookings with a properly filled out listing”\n",

      "The end of flat design?\n",
      "When the most design driven of the Fortune 500 CEOs talk about design trends we listen\n",
      "“By the way the design is a whole new aesthetic I’d like to make the announcement that I think flat design is over or ending I think if you remember the 2000s was dominated by skeuomorphism\n",
      "The 2010s have been dominated with the launch of iOS seven by flat design And I think we’re going to move back into a world with color texture dimensionality more haptic feedback but I don’t think it’s going to be skeuomorphism where it pretends to be a wood grain to reference a dashboard or leather but I think it’s going to have a sense of dimension ”\n",
      "His thesis is that we’re spending more time on screens so we want them to have some elements of a natural environment The new design paradigm embraces light texture and playfulness\n",
      "He also argues that AI can support the creation of such more interactive interfaces\n",
      "Airbnb’s icons were probably designed by a professional artist but we can definitely create something similar with AI To test that I’ve tried to replicate one of their icons on Midjourney\n",
      "Here’s what I got\n",
      "I’d say that’s close enough\n",
      "Simplicity isn’t going anywhere In fact most of Airbnb’s app is very straightforward and deeply focused on clarity and ease of use Their navigation is clear and their brand’s colors are only used strategically\n",
      "But we might be seeing the rise of a new kind of design style\n",
      "Leveraging AI for ease of use\n",
      "Another issue they found was that people just weren’t using the photo tour feature around 10% did\n",
      "Since photo tours are better organized than the standard sequence of images it made for worse listings overall And a bad listing might mean the factor that makes a person decide to go for the certainty of a hotel instead\n",
      "The solution they chose was very interesting using AI to sort the images automatically and reduce the work needed from the host That brought the user flow of adding and sorting images down to one single click Massively better experience\n",
